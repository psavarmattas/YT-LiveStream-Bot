_`Last Updated: January 15' 2021`_

Hello & Welcome to this git page. YT LiveStream Bot helps you to deploy bots on your LiveStream with a maximum (recomended) of 500 - 1000 bots from a single run of the program. It uses different proxys & device IDs so that you don't get noticed easily. Read the full documentation before using this bot.

To learn more about how I did it you can watch my YouTube
video on this or [click here]().

## Pre-Requisites:
_`If you want to run the .exe file`_

1. Python 3 installed in your windows machine (only supports windows devices but will proxy all types of devices).
2. Run the following commands:

    `pip install requests`

    `pip install colorama`

## Pre-Requisites:

6. A will to explore

When all the above pre-requisites are there and ready you can 
start to work on your own virtual assistant. Please follow each 
and every step in order & if you have any error just go to the issues
to see if you find any issue that matches your which is already

## Feature List (v1.0):

1. Uses different proxys to keep your IP Address untracable.

3. It has a proxy list of 40 IDs right now with growing numbers of new proxys being added frequently to maintain anonymity. 
4. Has an in-built requirements.txt file to help you just install all the required libraries in a single click.
